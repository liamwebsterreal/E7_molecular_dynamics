# E7_molecular_dynamics
This project was done as a part of UCB's E: 7 course curiculum. The project mission is to design and code a molecular dynamics simulation via MatLab. A generic simulation that approximates the intermolecular forces and energy of a group of 32 uncharged particles in a 1x1 box. Using mathematical functions and physics laws, the trajectory of each particle in the given box is animated in a 2 dimensional x y plane. To make the simulation more realistic, the expression of Lennard-Jones potential is applied, and a graph that compares intermolecular potential energy to intermolecular distance is displayed as a part of the programâ€™s result. In addition to the animated simulation, the average kinetic energy, potential energy, temperature, and pressure variation of the system are also calculated and plotted as graphs
